The second iteration of my personal website.

Primary goals: 
1. Create a place to tell my story (both short/long versions of it).
2. Share projects I've worked on in a way that can showcase my experience with different languages and tools, without breaking NDAs.
3. Learn and adapt different styles in HTML/CSS.
